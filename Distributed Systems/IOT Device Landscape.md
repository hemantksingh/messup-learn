# IOT Device Landscape

## Micro-controllers

Capable of processing multiple instructions rather than a device meant for doing a single thing. Microcontrollers are simpler. If you need to communicate with hardware and thats pretty much it and your app is not a complicated one then using C to wire up your microcontroller should suffice.

* Arduino Uno

## Systems on a Chip

Much more processing power and more memory than a micro-controller. Capable of running a desktop OS such as Windows and Linux. Consequently capable of running Node.js

* Arduino Yun
* Raspberry Pi
* Beaglebone Black
* MinnowBoard MAX
* Tessel
* Intel Edison (Wifi, Bluetooth LE built in)
