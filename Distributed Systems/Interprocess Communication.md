# Interprocess communication

Windows and Unix-variant operating systems provide different approaches to inter process communication (IPC) that facilitate communications and data sharing between applications. [This](http://cs.brown.edu/people/slewando/files/IPCWinNTUNIX.pdf) paper discusses some of the IPC options that are available to programmers using UNIX and describe the corresponding techniques available to programmers writing for Windows.

* Pipes
* Sockets
* Shared memory -e.g. [memory mapped files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/memory-mapped-files) contain the contents of a file in virtual memory that enables a process to treat the contents of a file as if they were a block of memory in the process's address space.
* Mailslots

Apart from the ones listed above [Windows provides a few additional IPC options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/interprocess-communications#using-pipes-for-ipc)

* Clipboard
* COM
* Data Copy
* DDE

## Sockets

Taken from [difference between Unix socket and TCP/IP socket](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46151707/is-there-a-difference-between-tcp-and-unix-socket)

A [UNIX socket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket), or Unix Domain Socket, is an inter-process communication mechanism that allows bidirectional data exchange between processes running on the same machine.

[IP sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket) (especially TCP/IP sockets) are a mechanism allowing communication between processes over the network. In some cases, you can use TCP/IP sockets to talk with processes running on the same computer (by using TCP loopback address: 127.0.0.1).

UNIX domain sockets know that theyâ€™re executing on the same system, so they can avoid some checks and operations (like routing); which makes them **faster and lighter than IP sockets**. So if you plan to communicate with processes on the same host, this is a better option than IP sockets.

UNIX domain sockets are subject to file system permissions, while TCP sockets can be controlled only on the packet filter level.

## Pipes

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/interprocess-communications#using-pipes-for-ipc

Anonymous pipes - one way, only for local communication, not over a network. Useful for communication between threads or parent and child processes.

Named pipes - support multiple clients talking to a server on the same machine or over a network. Can be one way or duplex

### Secure pipes

* Weakly ACL'd named pipes can be written to by low privilege processes
* Named pipes allow impersonation - ability of connected clients to use their oen permissions on remote servers. High privilege attacks can impersonate the caller and find information disclosed from the pipe.

You can define ACLs for a named pipe [using security descriptors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipe-security-and-access-rights). The ACLs in the default security descriptor for a named pipe grant full control to the LocalSystem account, administrators, and the creator owner. They also grant read access to members of the Everyone group and the anonymous account.

So in essence a pipe with a default security descriptor can only be accessed by the LocalSystem account.

## gRPC

gRPC calls between a client and service are usually sent over TCP sockets. TCP was designed for communicating across a network. Inter-process communication (IPC) is more efficient than TCP when the client and service are on the same machine. Consider using a transport like Unix domain sockets (UDS) or named pipes for gRPC calls between processes on the same machine. 

UDS are supported on Linux, macOS and modern versions of Windows. Support for the unix socket has existed both in BSD and Linux for the longest time, but, not on Windows. On Windows, there were some alternatives for local IPC, such as named pipes. But, calling conventions are different between the named pipes and sockets, making writing low-maintenance cross-platform applications difficult. [Windows 10 build 17063 provides support for unix socket](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/af_unix-comes-to-windows/) (AF_UNIX) address family on Windows to communicate between Win32 processes.
