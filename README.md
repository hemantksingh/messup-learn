# Mess-up and learn

Learnings from some successful and some failed experiments

Mess-up and learn is a sort of a mini wiki - a log of the lessons that I have learnt while running small experiments with things that interest me, books and blogs that I have read, the training that I have undergone, conferences that I have been to and the stack overflow articles that I have spent hours on.

Citations and references have been provided throughout, however some of the content is still under works and may need further refining. If you can't stop yourselves from pointing out any glaring gaps or if you just wish to contribute, please feel free to raise a PR ([pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)).
