## Aperture (AV)
Higher the aperture, more light comes in to the camera and narrower is the focus of the camera while blurring the other areas.

Lower the aperture, wider is the focus of the camera with a crisper image.

## Shutter speed (TV)
Longer the shutter is open for, more light comes in. Increase the shutter speed or lower the Time Value (TV) to capture moving objects.

## ISO
Yes it stands for International Standards Organization. It determines the sensitivity of the camera to light. Higher the ISO more sensitive the camera will be to light, therefore higher ISO is used in low light conditions but higher ISO also adds noise to the photograph. ISO is the culmination of three different systems for measuring camera sensitivity, including the The American Standards Association (ASA) and the Deutsches Institut fÃ¼r Normung (DIN) standards. 


## White balance
Determines the colours of the camera, basically telling the camera what white is because the rest of the colours depend upon white.

### Shadows and Highlights

For Day pictures that are dark:

* Shadows -> High
* Highlights -> Low
* Check Contrast & White Balance
* You can use the adjustment brush to selectively increase the exposure by painting the desired areas
* Radial filter allows you to selectively increase/decrease exposure outside the selected area.
* Side Effects -> Post crop vignetting

### Vibrance & Saturation

Both make the colours more vivid. Saturation does it for all the colours, vibrance is done a bit more intelligently where ever it is required.

## Clarity

High clarity gives you a high contrast HDR type of look.


### Hue Saturation Luminance

Hue - Change the type of a colour, going from red to yellow.
Luminance makes a colour more light or darker.


### Panoramic View

Select separate pictures and merge them to build a Panoramic view.
