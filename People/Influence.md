# Influencing others

Influencing others can only begin once you [know your own goal](Self%20Awareness.md) and have clarity about what you want to achieve. In a business this could be a shared organization goal or a team goal. It is only when you have a clear understanding of what you want that you are going to be able to articulate it to others. People are going to take you seriously only if you are clear in your thinking.

## Know your audience

Once you are clear of your own goal the next step is to know the people you are trying to influence. Fundamental technique of influencing  people is to **know them**. Looking at things from the others perspective is a key factor when dealing with people in demanding situations.

### Gather information

The key thing to consider before going into a discussion is whether you are going in to win an argument or to learn something that you may not be aware of or have factored in to your position. Going in with a willingness to learn will reassure people that their views are taken seriously and not brushed aside.

* Ask probing, diagnostics questions. e.g. *In what way, are there any patterns, when did this start happening?*
* Ask single open ended questions. e.g. *What, how, to what extent?*
* Perform a **fact finding** exercise to understand if any fears or concerns that they may have are perception or opinion based or backed by data.

### Listen, clarify and test assumptions

* To get to know the other person try and **summarise their position** by clarifying their objective. [Steel man your opponent's argument](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man) and assess what is it that you can learn from what they are saying? It is a mechanism of getting feedback on your position. If there is merit in the opposing argument or you can’t respond to the strongest argument from the other side, there’s a good chance you’re wrong. That's okay as long as you're willing to adjust your position.
* **Get a yes** *"Let me see if I can summarise your position.. what you would like to be able to achieve is... Is that right?"* After a few sessions of back and forth communication, you should get a clear understanding of their viewpoint.

## Align your goals

> *If there is one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as your own* - Henry Ford

* Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to think how they are thinking?
* What are the questions brewing in their mind. How will they react to your suggestions?
* Try to predict how the other person will react to a number of different suggestions. Talk this through with a colleague.
* Analyse a person’s motives for a particular action.
* What are they trying to achieve and why? What is their strategy? What impact does this have on your own objectives?
* **Invent** ways to align what they want with what you want.
  * *"What we could do is.."*
  * *"We can help you with..."*
  * *"There are several other options..."*

## Deliver a positive message that suits them - WIIFT

* Once you have understood the other person's motivations and desires and how these align with the shared goal, deliver a message that appeals to them even though the intention behind it is to meet your own goals. *bait the hook to suit the fish* rather than suit yourself. Rather than thinking about WiiFM (What’s in it for Me) think about the WiiFT (What’s in it for Them)

* Use positive language in your message: 'problems' become 'challenges', "weaknesses" become "opportunities for action" e.g.
  * Q: *Is the project going to be delivered in x weeks/months?*
  * A: *"There is a lot we can achieve in x weeks/months but the answer to your question is No.*

* Use word for word quotations from your fact findings for impact.
* Link your recommendations back to the findings e.g. Focus on Non functional requirements is based on the recent outage and security attacks on the website.

## Expand your network by finding allies and building relationships

* Connections come from conversations - making purposeful connections requires intentionally devoting time for conversations
  * you feel connected and energised while speaking to someone who are at the same frequency as you with shared experiences, struggles, motivations or passions
  * active listening - engaging in the conversation by asking questions (labels and mirrors)
  * provide psychological safety - be genuine and listen without any preconceived notions. The fact that someone hasn't opened up with you is likely because they may not feel psychologically safe to speak out. Realizing that you are not the finished article and showing your vulnerabilities allows others the space to open up about their own anxieties and fears

* Agreeing on common goals is key to expanding your influence across teams.

* Let others come up with the solution or recommendation that you wish to put forward. They are more likely to buy-in and commit to an idea if they have a sense of ownership. In order for an idea to spread throughout the organisation or even the world, sometimes it means to give up our own individual ownership of that to share with others. Make your idea bigger than yourself, make it ours.

* Getting others to help your cause is crucial in going beyond the power of your personal brand. In most organizations, goals get accomplished because a critical mass of people agree on those goals. Expand your power and influence by building on your personal and professional networks. You need to think about who in the organization - departments, people - do I need to have successful relationships with in order to influence effectively as I go about being successful at my role?

## Use objective criteria

* Draw attention to the need of the opportunity. Why is your idea so important? In a business context you want to think about the cost, resources, timeline and the customer impact of implementing your idea.
* Highlight risk and **focus the risk on the their objective**. Basically highlight the risk to them, your risk is most likely of no interest to them. e.g.
  * *We want quick results*  Taking action on incomplete information can result in a low quality product and damage the company's reputation.
  * *We want to rollout all the products together* - Risk of waste and overspend because it may result in not finishing any product.

## Adapt to situations

> *Its **not** about **you**, its about the cause bigger than you*

* Adjust your goals to avoid resistance, stepping on other's toes is never a good idea especially in its early stages.
  
* Allow people to surface any disagreements, counter arguments, and frustrations. Acknowledge that you've heard them and understand their point of view. *Get curious not furious* Engage them by allowing them to have some ownership of the outcome.

* Think about how you can use resistance to get critical feedback on your ideas and test underlying assumptions. Reframe the issue using questions like “How might we…?" to help people think differently about the issue. Invite them to explore different alternatives.

* In situations when you are not able to reach an agreement with a contrarian view, think about trade-offs and compromise. In such circumstances rather than being driven by personal ego, emotion or resentment, assess whether the proposed alternative still provides you a route to achieve your main goal. Focusing your mind on the common goals will provide you the perspective to whether support the alternative or not.
