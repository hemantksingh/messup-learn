# Influencing others

Influencing others can only begin once you **know your own goal** and what you want to achieve. In a business this could be a shared organisation goal or a team goal. It is only when you have a clear understanding of what you want that you are going to be able to articulate it to others. People are going to take you seriously only if you are clear in your thinking. 

## Know your audience

Once you are clear of your own goal the next step is to know the people you are trying to influence. Fundamental technique of influencing  people is to **know them**. Looking at things from the others perspective is a key factor when dealing with people in demanding situations.

### Gather information

The key thing to consider before going into a discussion is whether you are going in to win an argument or to learn something that you may not be aware of or have factored in to your position. Going in with a willingness to learn will reassure people that their views are taken seriously and not brushed aside.

* Ask probing, diagnostics questions. e.g. *In what way, are there any patterns, when did this start happening?*
* Ask single open ended questions. e.g. *What, how, to what extent?*
* Perform a **fact finding** exercise to understand if any fears or concerns that they may have are perception or opinion based or backed by data.

### Listen, clarify and test assumptions

* To get to know the other person try and **summarise their position** by clarifying their objective. [Steel man your opponent's argument](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man) and assess what is it that you can learn from what they are saying? It is a mechanism of getting feedback on your position. If there is merit in the opposing argument or you can’t respond to the strongest argument from the other side, there’s a good chance you’re wrong. That's okay as long as you're willing to adjust your position.
* **Get a yes** *"Let me see if I can summarise your position.. what you would like to be able to achieve is... Is that right?"* After a few sessions of back and forth communication, you should get a clear understanding of their viewpoint.

## Align your goals

"*If there is one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that persons's angle as well as your own*" - Henry Ford

* Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to think how they are thinking?
* What are the questions brewing in their mind. How will they react to your suggestions?
* Try to predict how the other person will react to a number of different suggestions. Talk this through with a colleague.
* Analyse a person’s motives for a particular action.
* What are they trying to achieve and why? What is their strategy? What impact does this have on your own objectives?
* **Invent** ways to align what they want with what you want.
  * *"What we could do is.."*
  * *"We can help you with..."*
  * *"There are several other options..."*

## Deliver a positive message that suits them

* Once you have understood the other person's motivations and desires and how these align with the shared goal, deliver a message that appeals to them even though the intention behind it is to meet your own goals. *bait the hook to suit the fish* rather than suit yourself.
  
* Use positive language in your message: 'problems' become 'challenges', "weaknesses" become "opportunities for action" e.g.
  * Q: *Is the project going to be delivered in x weeks/months?*
  * A: *"There is a lot we can achieve in x weeks/months but the answer to your question is No.*

* Use word for word quotations from your fact findings for impact.
* Link your recommendations back to the findings e.g. Focus on Non functional requirements is based on the recent outage and security attacks on the website.

## Use objective criteria

* Highlight risk and **focus the risk on the their objective**. Basically highlight the risk to them, your risk is most likely of no interest to them. e.g.
  * *We want quick results*  Taking action on incomplete information can result in a low quality product and damage the company's reputation.
  * *We want to rollout all the products together* - Risk of waste and overspend because it may result in not finishing any product.
