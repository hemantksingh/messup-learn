## Architect

> What does a software/technical architect role offer? Is it relevant for self empowered agile teams? 

Whilst the role of a product owner is primarily to look at problems from the end user - the customer point of view, an architect looks at the solution to problems from an engineering lens - how can you make the life of the developer a bit easier and whether you can help automate the process of manufacturing and operating software, keeping the business goals in mind?

* Create and evolve technical strategy based on business goals
  * have a view of current state and a target state
  * look inwards and outwards, liaise with internal and external parties to bridge silos and minimise cross team dependencies
* De-risk delivery
  * look into the future
  * help define guardrails/boundaries/governance
  * enable production readiness - depending upon the business strategy optimize for operational excellence, security, performance, resilience, cost and sustainability
* Focus on delivering and measuring value
  * Use data to drive decisions
  * Identify what to measure and the key metrics to help support that
  * Look at quantitative as well as qualitative metrics
* Getting results through others
  * As opposed to taking on too much work upon yourself, provide support - shepherding people in the right direction
  * From player to coach, from doing to getting it done
* Support dev teams with
  * making technical decisions, or more importantly avoid making drastic decisions
  * alignment with business goals, think big picture and help translate that into day to day
* Represent engineering to the wider business, stakeholders and/or project sponsors
  * extend the team's reach
  * work in the open - demonstrate progress transparently

## Infrastructure/Cloud Architect  

Someone who can work within organizations to bring **people, processes and products** together to enable continuous delivery of value to end users.

* Transforming infra/ops departments (i.e. reorganising them and getting them to adopt agile practices across the department, bridging silos and adopt DevOps culture by having **cross functional teams** capable of building, running, securing and supporting their apps.

* People who know what it's like to shape and manage Cloud migrations strategies, who can talk to a client about the impact of moving to cloud on their budgeting **moving from CapEx to OpEx** (e.g moving from owning a car to renting a car), managing technical budgets and pros and cons of adoption of IAAS, PAAS or FAAS.

* Driving operational excellence - understand change management (e.g. CI/CD workflows, rollback and backup strategies), incident management and security auditing controls

## Software Engineer

Some competencies to look out for:

* Ability to sell your ideas e.g. get buy-in for tech debt
  * provide solid building blocks for rapid delivery
  * reduce the number of support issues in a particular area of the code
* Working in the open - demonstrate progress transparently
  * able to switch from individual contributor to collaborate with the wider team
  * run demos and share progress with others

### Technical skills

* Problem solving - What is the problem you are looking to solve as opposed to what technology you want to use?
* Drive innovation responsibly (by running small experiments)
* Drive quality via automation and adopting best practices while keeping delivery timescales in mind
  * reduce time to live
    * reduce regression cycles and manual testing effort
    * reduce operational overhead by implementing chaos testing, security testing and performance testing
  * measure customer value
    * analytics to understand customer behavior and trends
    * feature usage

### Breadth of knowledge  
  
* TDD - demonstrate understanding of
  * different levels of tests in the testing pyramid
  * approaches to testing - top down, bottom up
  * best practices
    * testing behavior as opposed to implementation
    * separation of production code from test code
    * mocking at architectural boundaries
* CICD - branching techniques, impact of frequent releases, feature toggling, blue green deployments
* REST APIs - significance of REST interface, idempotent operations, authentication techniques
* DBs - relational and non-relational DB trade offs

## Fact finding techniques

### Competency skills

To get someone talking, it is a good idea to keep the discussion informal. However, you are always looking for examples of certain key competencies. To kick off a conversation [Amazon leadership questions](https://www.yoreoyster.com/blog/amazon-leadership-principles-questions/) is a good place to start looking for potential behavioral questions. While the degree of expertise may vary but these competency skills apply generally across all roles:

* Ownership/Accountability - Tell me about an unpopular decision of yours? Are they individually driven or lean on decisions made by the team?
* Action/Results oriented - What is more important - getting things right or meeting deadlines/delivering value to customers? Understand how they manage competing priorities.
* Simplification/Passion - Tell me about a time when you simplified or innovated something and it went wrong?
* Teamwork/Humility - What do you do to gain the trust of your teammates?

### Active listening

* During a conversation, you can adopt the [labels and mirrors](https://blog.blackswanltd.com/the-edge/7-negotiation-techniques-for-introverts) technique to learn more about others
  * Use labels to dig deep into a persons core emotional drives
    * It looks like
    * It sounds like
  * Seek clarification using mirrors
    * by repeating the last one to three words that were spoken in an inquisitive, questioning tone

* To get a sense of organizational structure and ways of working within a company you can start by asking how does the team you work for fit into the wider business?
  * This should provide you a view of how work and value flow through the org and where the bottlenecks/silos may be?
  * The question that you are eventually looking to answer is whether technology drives business strategy and whether data is used for decision making?

### Selling the role you are recruiting for

* Find out what they are looking for and the motivations for leaving their current role
* You can talk about where your team currently is and where you want to get to in the future - the why, how and what now. Highlight the importance of the opportunity to improve and innovate
* Culture and the working environment - autonomy, collaboration and support
  * continuous delivery
  * architecture decisions
  * automation focus
* While seeking answers to your questions you can provide specific examples of your current environment that maybe a good fit for the candidate to gauge their interest
