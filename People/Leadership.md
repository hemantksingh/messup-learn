# Leadership

Leadership is about empowering others to achieve their full potential. 

## Delegation

- Getting results through others
- From player to coach
- From doing to leading
- Team is more important than you. You're no longer seeking your individual goals but the team goals
- Avoid being the bottleneck

## Direction Alignment and Commitment (DAC)

Influence helps frame direction, alignment, and commitment among individuals, teams, groups, organizations. It enables you to get the kind of results you really want through others and that's what leadership is all about.

A confidence score on a proposal at the end of a meeting is a good way to guage the commitment levels of a team.

## Communication

Why, what, how and now what? Know your audience, if you are presenting to senior leadership, they are probably going to be interested in the cost, timeline, resource required and the customer impact of your initiative.
