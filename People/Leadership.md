# Leadership

Leadership is empowering others to achieve their true potential.

## Delegation

- Getting results through others
- From player to coach
- From doing to leading
- Team is more important than you. You're no longer seeking your individual goals but the team goals
- Avoid being the bottleneck

## Direction Alignment and Commitment (DAC)

Questions about goals, priorities and measures of success are key in determining the team direction. Influence helps frame direction, alignment, and commitment among individuals, teams, groups, organizations. It enables you to get the kind of results you really want through others and that's what leadership is all about.

A confidence score on a proposal at the end of a meeting is a good way to gauge the commitment levels of a team.
