# Leadership

How do you empower others to achieve their best - their true potential? The foundations of strong leadership revolve around seeing others get better and seeking satisfaction in other people's success.

- Culture - Creating the environment for others to succeed
  - Lead by example
    - Culture is not about what you say, its about what you do. Great leaders don't just talk culture, they embody it, authentically.
    - In *The Corporate Culture*, Schien defines culture as a "pattern of shared tacit assumptions that was learned by a group as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration,that has worked well enough to be considered valid and therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think and feel in relation to those problems." You can let your teams culture emerge or be explicit about it by encouraging specific behaviors that
  - Establish safety and openness
    - get to know each other: background, goals, fun, strengths, weaknesses
    - discourage blame e.g. are people given the autonomy to act and trusted to take risks? Is failure punished or does it lead to enquiry and improvements of our systems?
    - say no to talented jerks - scientific experiments have shown jerks diminish a team's performance by 30-40%
  - Establish vulnerability - As a leader the most important thing that you can say to your team is - *I messed up* or *I need help to achieve x*
  - Create purpose - the yearning to do something larger than ourselves.
  - Keep the culture alive (culture capture) 
    - seek and provide constructive feedback. What excites them, what frustrates them, what is their biggest challenge? 
    - surveys and questionnaires to measure e.g. Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire (DLOQ) is a tool designed to assess the following five dimensions of a learning organization:
      - Continuous learning: This dimension measures an organization's commitment to ongoing learning and improvement through training, development, and knowledge sharing.
      - Participative decision making: This dimension assesses the degree to which employees are involved in decision making processes and encouraged to contribute their ideas and expertise.
      - Team learning: This dimension measures the extent to which teams collaborate and share knowledge to achieve common goals.
      - Embedded systems for learning: This dimension assesses the presence and effectiveness of systems and processes within the organization to support learning and knowledge sharing.
      - Visionary leadership: This dimension measures the leadership's commitment to fostering a culture of learning and supporting learning initiatives.

- Delegation
  - Getting results through others requires you to shift from being a player to coach, from doing to leading. Avoid being the bottleneck by taking on too much work yourself, let others take ownership of initiatives where you provide guidance and support.
  - Set clear expectations and stating expectations once isn't enough. They must be repeated, clarified, and adjusted over time. Can those you lead clearly explain what you expect from them? Many people strive to do a good job, while some may not. Nevertheless, the majority of people find satisfaction in completing their tasks to a high standard.
  - Putting the team before you. Commit to the success and well-being of the collective team above your individual success.

- Direction Alignment and Commitment (DAC)
  - There are a couple of ways to think about DAC:
    - Push mode, where your are may use your influence and try to set expectations across the board and getting everyone to pull in the same direction. 
    - Pull mode, where you seek information from your team and synthesise the information to agree on a set of principles that everyone buys into and has a shared understanding of. This allows decisions to be made objectively. In case personal motivations of individuals do not align the principles can be revisited and revised so that they work for everyone or a safe way out for those individuals that aren't willing to come on the journey needs to be considered.
  - Questions about goals, priorities and measures of success are key in determining the team direction.
  - A good way to gauge the commitment levels of a team is to get a confidence score on a proposal for example at the end of a meeting.

- Self awareness
  - requires gaining your own perspective and how you come across to others  
  - internal strategies for learning more about yourself include
    - journaling
    - reflection
    - meditation
  - external formal strategies include
    - personality tests
    - self assessment surveys and questionnaires
    - performance appraisals
  - informal strategies include casual conversations
  
- Learning agility
  - Ability to "process on the fly" and pull together disparate bits of information
  - Seeking for new, challenging learning opportunities.
  - Sense making is an ongoing dialogue used to gain insight from the situation.
  - Internalizing happens through getting feedback and reflecting.
  - Applying is trying to map previous experience to new situations by adapting.

## Communication

Understanding that not all people are the same and that they are driven by different motivations is crucial to knowing them. People fall into different [personality traits](https://openpress.usask.ca/introductiontopsychology/chapter/personality-traits), however the deepest urge in all human nature is

- **the desire to be important** - John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosopher. It is what Freud calls "the desire to be great". The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.
  - Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in our praise. **Recognition** and sincere appreciation is one of the secrets of dealing with people. Charles Schwab - one of the first people to be paid a salary of 1 million dollars a year says he was paid his salary because of his ability to deal with people. "*I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people*" said Schwab. The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. The difference between appreciation and flattery? One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other is selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
  - Strive to provide positive as well as constructive **feedback**. When you do, you help people get better at their jobs. You let them know what is expected from them, as well as the good things you want them to continue to do. Using SIB (Situation Behavior and Impact) technique to provide feedback helps you to be precise about the time and place (situation), stick to the facts (behavior) and to uncover the impact - how it made you feel.
  
- **the desire to belong** - people are social animals and have the innate ability to gravitate towards others with common shared values and beliefs, form communities and cultures. When you are surrounded by people with shared values and beliefs - trust emerges.
  - You find others with similar beliefs and values by striking conversations and **becoming genuinely interested in them**. Often liking someone is a gut instinct, an intuitive decision, because it just feels right. The part of your brain that controls feeling, controls decision making it doesn't control language, it cannot rationalize why you like someone.
  - Clarity about your beliefs and values gives you a purpose. Ability to clearly communicate your vision and repeat it often can rally others behind your cause
  - A carrot and stick (reward and punishment) policy is effective in routine, mechanical work, but actually reduces performance in the context of knowledge work. Rewarding efforts as opposed to outcomes taps into the intrinsic motivations of people encouraging them to take risks and innovate and be okay with failure.
  - >*If you want people to be truly engaged in your vision give them **autonomy, mastery and purpose*** - Daniel Pink
  
### Engage and build trust

To become genuinely interested in other people and gain their trust, you have to go beyond the small talk and have meaningful conversations keeping their interests in mind.

- Skip the small talk, start with personal questions. Move from **How are you** to **Who you are** conversations. So instead of asking
  - *Where did you grow up?* ask *Whats your story, where do you come from?*
  - *How is it going? Is everything turning out the way you thought it would*?
  - [Here](https://introvertdear.com/news/introverts-5-hacks-to-turn-small-talk-into-meaningful-conversation/) are few hacks to turn small talk into meaningful conversations
- People like to know that they are interesting. Doing some research about your prospect to find out what interests them most and what they are enthusiastic about, before an important meeting can help you in getting their attention.
  - *You have a very interesting name, whats the story behind that?*
  - After they finish what they have to say: *Thats interesting* or if they have been interrupted: *You were saying something interesting, please finish*
  - Working with you is always so easy
  - Last time we talked you mentioned you were doing this training - how did that go?
- Use positive phrases while starting conversations:
  - *Hey Brad I was just thinking about you, How are you?*
  - Anytime someone calls you - I'm so glad you called, I was just thinking about you the other day
  - The other day I was watching this Netflix documentary and I thought of you
  - Hey long time no talk, someone recently talked to me about a great lawyer recommendation and I thought of you
- Expressing vulnerability
  - People wait for you to share something intimate before opening up to you. After sharing something intimate, you may finish with *What about you?*
  - Showing up at events and gatherings is one way of proving what you believe. Increasing your exposure can increase your likeability
  - Providing reassurance during a difficult decision. Show that you are concerned, ask what's worrying them? e.g. *I sense there's something worrying you?*
- Adopt **active listening**. When people come to you with a problem, your instinct may be is to give them a solution right away. Sometimes a deeper issue might need to be uncovered by just listening and letting the other person speak. To surface the underlying issue you can adopt the [labels and mirrors](https://blog.blackswanltd.com/the-edge/7-negotiation-techniques-for-introverts) technique or just say *Tell me more*
  > *Listen to listen not to reply*

### Getting your message across

- Whether you are a newspaper journalist, a politician or a rapper we are all trying to do the same thing. It is to get your message across. So the why, what, how and now what of your message becomes crucially important, however the primary focus ought to be on the **why** of your message.
- Get your message across. *You haven't taught until they have learnt*. Seek confirmation that the words you say are well understood. Willingness to repeat will ensure your message lands.
- Know your audience. People in position of responsibility will check your confidence in your decisions. In order to get to the facts, they will often dig deep, sometimes through confrontation. If you are pitching an idea to senior leadership, they are probably going to be most interested in the **why and now what** (cost, timeline, resource required and the customer impact) of your message.
  - Preempt the question. Get in there first before any obvious questions are asked.
  - In a *yes/no* decision come to 0 to 100% position e.g. *Based on our fact finding exercise and the data collected we are 100% sure of our recommendations*
  - On discovering new information (e.g. Organization restructure plan), **bounce a question back**, e.g. *So what impact would the organization restructure have on the project teams?*
  - Get back with an answer in case of an unknown. Mention the **process** you will follow to get the answer. Give an indicative answer to manage expectations. *In our experience ...*
  - Bounce a question back. Have you set out a budget for this piece of work?
- Using humour to put your point across can be effective communication strategy in certain situations. Avoid plagiarizing but use inspiration.
- Consider the impact of body language and non verbal communication on your message. This requires you to be fully present and be mindful of not only the thoughts but also the emotions around you.
  - Closed positions like crossed arms represent defensiveness
  - Open hands and hand movements while speaking represent confidence
  - Eye movements give out a lot about whether you are being listened to or ignored

## Influence

- Why should anyone listen to you? Reflect on your level of influence and where it comes from
  - Genuineness?
  - Confidence with clarity?
- You cannot win an argument - Avoid proving someone wrong, even if they are. Let them have their moment of authority and deflect the conversation onto something positive. Conflict can be seen as 'influence failed'. Remember - *Conflict is **not** about **you***
  - Change people without giving offense or arouse resentment. Always **talk about your own mistakes first**. If you have made a mistake, admit that you're wrong and do it emphatically rather than defending yourself. *Dale Carnegie* suggests you own your mistake and vent how terrible the mistake was so you deflate the other person's anger.
    > *The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want*
  - When disagreeing with someone **make your point in a general sense**. Tackle the problem rather than the individual. Rejection of a viewpoint results in anger and pain
  - Rather than saying *"No, the Community of Practice is a something that cannot be done away with"*, say something like
    >*Whilst commercials of the business are of great importance, in order to drive new thinking and engage people it is important for them to get together and align on shared values and goals*

- [Influencing others](./Influence.md) requires you to build relationships and network for supporting your initiatives. Explore how you can engage and include others in the early stages of your initiative to get their buy-in and support
- You can communicate the risks and benefits of a particular approach e.g. I'd recommend you not going down that route, would be delighted to be proven wrong. Even if your recommendation is not accepted, it is still better to offer support and assurance to be there in case things do not work out

## Political savvy

- Consider the importance of dealing with workplace politics to effectively operate within an organization. Workplace politics is neither good nor bad, having a good network in the organization allows you to navigate office politics.
- Strategies for skillfully handling politics
  - Read and adjust to the environment: look for where politics are involved and adjust to that
  - Build relationships: find common ground
  - Be credible and confident: demonstrate an understanding of the business
  - Be authentic and caring. A question worth asking is *If you could change one thing about the way we work, what would it be ?*

## Motivation

- Motivation techniques
  - Inspire commitment via extrinsic and intrinsic motivation techniques. Carrot and stick (extrinsic reward & punishment) has a limited effect when dealing with people.
  - The deepest human urge is the desire to be important and great and the desire to belong. Give people what they most desire:
    - Recognition - arouse enthusiasm amongst others. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in our praise.
    - Clarity about your beliefs and values gives you a purpose. Ability to clearly communicate your vision and repeat it often can rally others behind your cause. Letting people operate at a level where they are stretched but not stressed, leads to mastery.

- Values
  - Consider the importance of values to help people connect with their work and get results
  - Reflect on your values and how they connect to your work and the goals of your organization
  - Explore how you might connect other people’s values to your current challenges to get their support and move forward
- Vision
  - Consider the power of a compelling vision to create a shared direction and motivation within a group
  - Reflect on the vision of your team or organization and how your work furthers it
