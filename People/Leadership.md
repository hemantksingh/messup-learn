# Leadership

Leadership is about empowering others to achieve their true potential. The foundations of strong leadership:

- Culture is not about what you say, its about what you do - lead by example. Culture is what people do when no-one is looking. Its about specific behaviours that 
  - establish safety and openness
    - get to know each other: background, goals, fun, strengths, weeknesses
    - discourage blame e.g. difference between the safety culture in aviation (facts based) and healthcare industry
    - say no to talented jerks - scientific experiments have shown jerks diminish a team's performance by 30-40%
  - establish vulnerability - As a leader the most important thing that you can say to your team is - *I messed up* or *I need help to achieve x*
  - create purpose
  - keep the culture alive (culture capture) - seek and provide constructive feedback. What excites them, what frustrates them, what is their biggest challenge?

- Delegation
  - Getting results through others
  - From player to coach. From doing to leading. Avoid being the bottleneck by taking on too much work yourself, let others take ownership of initiatives where you provide guidance and support.
  - Putting the team before you. Commit to the success and well-being of the collective team above your individual success.

- Direction Alignment and Commitment (DAC)
  - Trying to set expectations across the board while working with distributed teams and getting everyone to pull in the same direction can be a challenge. Getting the team to agree on a set of principles that everyone buys into and has a shared understanding is one way of driving DAC. This allows decisions to be made objectively. However if personal motivations do not align the principles can be revisited and revised so that they work for everyone.
  - Questions about goals, priorities and measures of success are key in determining the team direction. Influence helps frame direction, alignment, and commitment among individuals, teams, groups, organizations. It enables you to get the kind of results you want through others.
  - A good way to gauge the commitment levels of a team is to get a confidence score on a proposal for example at the end of a meeting.

- Self awareness
  - requires gaining your own perspective and how you come across to others  
  - internal strategies for learning more about yourself include
    - journaling
    - reflection
    - meditation
  - external formal strategies include
    - personality tests
    - self assessment surveys and questionnaires
    - performance appraisals
  - informal strategies include casual conversations
  
- Learning agility
  - Seeking for new, challenging learning opportunities.
  - Sense making is an ongoing dialogue used to gain insight from the situation.
  - Internalizing happens through getting feedback and reflecting.
  - Applying is trying to map previous experience to new situations by adapting.

## Communication

- Why, what, how and now what? Focus more on the why of your message.
- Get your message across. *You haven't taught until they have learnt*. Seek confirmation that the words you say are well understood. Willingness to repeat will ensure your message lands.
- Adopt active listening. When people come to you with a problem, your instinct may be is to give them a solution right away. Sometimes a deeper issue might need to be uncovered by just listening and letting the other person speak. To surface the underlying issue you can adopt labels and mirros technique or just say *Tell me more*  
- Know your audience. If you are pitching an idea to senior leadership, they are probably going to be most interested in the why and now what (cost, timeline, resource required and the customer impact) of your message.
- Consider the impact of body language and non verbal communication on your message. Practicing mindfulnes, deep breathing and visualization before an important presentation can help in calming nerves and relaxation.
- Strive to provide constructive as well as positive feedback. When you do, you help people get better at their jobs. You let them know what is expected from them, as well as the good things you want them to continue to do. Using SIB (Situation Behavior and Impact) technique to provide feedback helps you to be precise about the time and place (situation), stick to the facts (behavior) and to uncover the impact - how it made you feel.

## Influence

- [Influencing others](./Influence.md) requires you to build relationships and network for supporting your initiatives
- Explore how you can engage and include others in the early stages of your challenge to get their buy-in and support
- You can communicate the risks and benefits of a particular approach e.g. I'd recommend you not going down that route, would be delighted to be proven wrong. If your recommendation is not accepted, you can offer to be there and available in case the adopted approach does not work out
- Manage conflict - Conflict can be seen as 'influence failed', reflect on your level of influence and where it comes from. You cannot win an argument - Avoid proving someone wrong, even if they are. Let them have their moment of authority and deflect the conversation onto something positive.

## Political savy

- Consider the importance of dealing with workplace politics to effectively operate within an organization. Workplace politics is neither good nor bad, having a good network in the organization allows you to navigate office politics.
- Strategies for skillfully handling politics
  - Read and adjust to the environment: look for where politics are involved and adjust to that
  - Build relationships: find common ground.
  - Be credible and confident: demonstrate an understanding of the business.
  - Be authentic and caring. A question worth asking is *If you could change one thing about the way we work, what would it be ?*

## Motivation

- Motivation techniques
  - Inspire commitment via extrinsic and intrinsic motivation techniques. Carrot and stick (extrinsinc reward & punishment) has a limited effect when dealing with people. The deepest human urge is the desire to be important and to be great. Give people what they most desire:
    - Recognition - arouse enthusiasm amongst others. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in our praise.
    - Purpose, autonomy and mastery - A clear vision that is repeated often gives people a purpose. Letting people operate at a level where they are stretched but not stressed, leads to mastery. 

- Values
  - Consider the importance of values to help people connect with their work and get results
  - Reflect on your values and how they connect to your work and the goals of your organization
  - Explore how you might connect other peopleâ€™s values to your current challenges to get their support and move forward
- Vision
  - Consider the power of a compelling vision to create a shared direction and motivation within a group
  - Reflect on the vision of your team or organization and how your work furthers it
