# Leadership

Empowering others to achieve their true potential. The foundations of strong leadership:

- Delegation
  - Getting results through others
  - From player to coach. From doing to leading. Avoid being the bottleneck by taking on too much work yourself, let others take ownership of initiatives where you provide guidance and support.
  - Putting the team before you. Commit to the success and well-being of the collective team above your individual success.

- Direction Alignment and Commitment (DAC)
  - Trying to set expectations across the board while working with distributed teams and getting everyone to pull in the same direction can be a challenge. Getting the team to agree on a set of principles that everyone buys into and has a shared understanding is one way of driving DAC. This allows decisions to be made objectively. However if personal motivations do not align the principles can be revisited and revised so that they work for everyone.
  - Questions about goals, priorities and measures of success are key in determining the team direction. Influence helps frame direction, alignment, and commitment among individuals, teams, groups, organizations. It enables you to get the kind of results you really want through others and that's what leadership is all about.
  - A good way to gauge the commitment levels of a team is to get a confidence score on a proposal for example at the end of a meeting.

- Self awareness
  - requires gaining your own perspective and how you come across to others

    - journaling
    - reflection
    - meditation

  - Sense making is an ongoing dialogue used to gain insight from the situation.
  - Internalizing happens through getting feedback and reflecting.

## Communication

- Getting your message across
- Why, what, how and now what? Focus on the why of your message.
- Know your audience, if you are presenting to senior leadership, they are probably going to be interested in the cost, timeline, resource required and the customer impact of your initiative.
- Consider the impact of body language and non verbal communication on your message. Practicing mindfulnes, deep breathing and visualization before an important presentation can help in calming nerves and relaxation.
- Strive to provide constructive as well as positive feedback. When you do, you help people get better at their jobs. You let them know what is expected from them, as well as the good things you want them to continue to do. Using SIB (Situation Behavior and Impact) technique to provide feedback helps you to be precise about the time and place (situation), stick to the facts (behavior) and to uncover the impact - how it made you feel.
