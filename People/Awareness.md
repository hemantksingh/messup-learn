# Being aware of your goal

The origins of your personal goal may be due to resentment and agitation within yourselves - the desire to change or fix something in your life that doesn't let you sleep at night. So the pursuit of your goal may have a selfish origin within an agitated mind. However an unstable mind filled with resentment and anger clouds your intellect and you will struggle to have clarity of thought on how to go about achieving your goal. Therefore it becomes necessary to develop purity of thought and unselfishness in your goals with a larger purpose that is beyond your immediate self.

*Money is not a bad thing if profit is for the purpose of wider positive impact.*

Just like the human body needs oxygen to survive, a business needs profit to survive and flourish, however the job of humans is more than just breathing. Similarly, if businesses are run with an intention to serve, profit can be utilized for the wider good. The drive for profit ensures the business is run efficiently without waste and holds the business accountable to its share holders.

In order to attract people to you, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose. Not all people are at the same levels of consciousness, they are functioning at different frequencies. If you can elevate them towards a heightened state of consciousness - your end goal with a vision of positive change, your engagement with others will be at the same frequency. This leads to deeper engagement and ultimately - harmony.

*If you work just for yourself, the whole world seems against you. If you work for others, the whole world is with you*

## Enhancing consciousness

Staying aware of one thing for prolonged amount of time and not drift away requires practice 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If you can integrate this into everything that you do throughout your life, you can get better at it.

* Perform small rituals throughout the day that remind you about your purpose. How many things do we do during the day with our at most concentration to be in a heightened state of awareness ?

* Simplify your day to day life with less material possessions. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. Energy flows to where your awareness goes. Material possessions can consume energy. Fewer possessions mean less loss (haemorrhaging) of energy. One of the goals for monks is conservation of energy.

## Building will power

* Affirmation - remind yourself of your main goal and how you're going to get there with a clear choice of concise words
* Clear visualization of success - remind yourself of the fulfillment you get after completing a task and taking it to its logical end on the way to achieving your main goal
