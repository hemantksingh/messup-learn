# Being aware of your goal

In order to attract people to you, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose.

Not all people are at the same levels of consciousness, they are functioning at different frequencies. If you can elevate them towards a heightened state of consciousness (your end goal, provided you have a clear understanding of it), your engagement with others will be at the same frequency. This leads to harmony.

## Enhancing consciousness

*Money is not a bad thing if profit is for the purpose of positive impact*

Staying aware of one thing for prolonged amount of time and not drift away requires practice 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If you can integrate this into everything that you do throughout your life, you can get better at it.

* Perform small rituals throughout the day that remind you about your purpose. How many things do we do during the day with our at most concentration to be in a heightened state of awareness ?

* Simplify your day to day life with less material possessions. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. Energy flows to where your awareness goes. Material possessions can consume energy. Fewer possessions mean less loss (haemorrhaging) of energy. One of the goals for monks is conservation of energy.

## Building will power

* Affirmation with choice of concise words
* Clear visualization of success - remember the positive feeling you get after completing something and taking it to its logical end.
