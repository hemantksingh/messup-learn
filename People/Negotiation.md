# Negotiation

Negotiation and conflict are somewhat indistinguishable. Its easy to avoid conflict moment to moment but you pay a heavy price in the long term. Its better to be courageous and face conflict forthrightly in the present to make peace with the future. Overcome your hesitancy to engage in conflict.

Negotiation involves people and people have fears, desires, emotions, deeply held values, different backgrounds and viewpoints and they are unpredictable. So are you. Therefore it is important to understand their sensitivities and interests.

## Focus on the interests rather than positions

In a negotiation having clear view of what you want and keeping your interests separate from your position prevents you from losing sight of the larger goal. It is similar to keeping the part of the brain that invents, separate from the part of the brain that evaluates.

Focus on why you are entering into a negotiation, what is the **underlying motivation** or your end goal. How to focus on the interest - by not being reactive (do not act without thinking), not losing perspective of your end goal and staying calm, collective and in control.
  
## Separate the people from the problem

This allows you to be hard on the problem but soft on the people.

* You can be soft on the people by **listening** to them, putting yourself in their shoes and understanding what exactly they want.
* To get to know the other person try and **summarise their position** by clarifying their objective.
* **Get a yes** *"Let me see if I can summarise your position.. what you would like to be able to achieve is... Is that right?"* After a few sessions of back and forth communication, you should get a clear understanding of their viewpoint.

## Invent alternatives

Come up with variety of options to get alignment and reach a **win-win agreement**. Once you have understood the other person's motivations and desires, find a way to articulate your message that appeals to them even though the intention is to meet your goals. *bait the hook to suit the fish* rather than suit yourself. If you can **align** your interest with the other person's interest you are more likely to reach a favourable outcome.
  
## Insist on using objective criteria

If you can't reach a mutually beneficial agreement, act like a judge and insist on using objective criteria to decide your case.

* What's your basis?
* How did you arrive at that figure?

## Develop your BATNA

 Best alternative to a negotiated agreement is basically **being prepared for the worst**. Before going into a negotiation, an important question to ask yourself is how are we going to meet our interest if for some reason we do not reach an agreement with that particular person at that particular time. Knowing your BATNA beforehand prepares you for a worst case scenario. Having alternative options ready can give you more negotiating power.
