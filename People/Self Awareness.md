# Self awareness

*Your own self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world* - Ramana Maharishi

Your greatest contribution to humanity is your own self realization. As you uplift yourself you uplift everyone else around you. But what precisely does it mean to be self-aware? How did self-awareness emerge as a venerable trait and [how do you cultivate it](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/click-here-happiness/201903/what-is-self-awareness-and-how-do-you-get-it)? We lead busy lives that are mostly lived with an outward focus on things around us rather than within us. According to a [study](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/) from Microsoft, people can only concentrate for a length of eight seconds - an attention span shorter than a goldfish. How do you expect to solve the world's problems when your average attention span is eight seconds? Self awareness is about taking time to sit with yourself, look inwards and get to know your body, your mind and get to know yourself better. Knowing who you are, what your personal values and your preferences are, the differences between you and the people around you are, can help you objectively evaluate yourself, manage your emotions and align your behavior with your goals.

## Knowing yourself

It is important to be self aware and also how you are perceived. They are both important. In the pursuit of self awareness, there are a few things that we all should learn and know. Firstly, how the mind works. Then learning to focus. Followed by the understanding of how our energy works. And once we have a decent understanding of this, then knowing our purpose in life. Why do I think the above items are crucial? If you don’t understand how your mind works and you can’t focus it, then it is going to be difficult to begin the journey of getting to know yourself. And if you can’t get to know yourself then it’s going to be difficult to know your purpose in life. Your purpose tells you where you put your energy. A purposeful life allows you to be concentrated for extended periods of time on people and things that matter most, making each experience joyful, the byproduct of which is happiness. Happiness itself is not the goal but a byproduct of leading a focussed and meaningful life.

The goal is to gain a conscious mastery of awareness in the mind and be able to take awareness and move it to any area of the mind that you want it to go.

*If you are able to control where your awareness goes in the mind, you can control where your energy flows. If you can control where your energy flows you can control what manifests in your life.*

Believe that you have the ability to create whatever you want in your life and proceed with confidence.

### How the mind works?

In the context of mindfulness it is often said: to be in the moment, to be present right here, right now. That just means to be able to sustain your awareness for an extended period of time and not let it wander away into different areas of the mind. This could be while you are at work, reading a book, talking to someone or you are in the middle of a beautiful experience. Concentration is the very core of all human endeavour and success and allows you to truly enjoy every experience in your life and be present.

[Dandapani](https://dandapani.org/) describes concentration as the act of keeping your awareness on a particular area of the mind for an extended amount of time. The goal is not to control your mind but to control where awareness goes within your mind. Prolonged sates of concentration is where the magic happens. It leads to high engagement, deeper relationships and building the power of observation. Power of observation allows you to stay out of the weeds and see things from a birds eye view where you can clearly see opportunities, pitfalls and make better decisions. The byproduct of pursuing a lifestyle with high concentration and focus is happiness.

### Enhancing concentration

How many things do we do during the day with our at most concentration? Staying aware of one thing for prolonged amount of time without drifting away requires practice 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If you can integrate this into everything that you do throughout your day and throughout your life you can be in a heightened state of consciousness.

* Repetition, patience, slow hard work and doing seemingly mundane tasks train the mind for concentration. Like you train the body e.g. an old school boxing coach will literally make you do footwork for a year or throw a jab in the air before teaching you any other boxing moves.
* Build extraordinary habits by performing small rituals that constantly remind you of your goals.
* Simplify your day to day life with less material possessions. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. Energy flows to where your awareness goes. Material possessions e.g. mobile phones and social media are a great source of distraction and energy consumption. Fewer possessions mean less haemorrhaging of energy.

### Build will power

You use your will to take your awareness from one area of the mind to another and develop concentration. Will power is like a muscle and it needs to be cultivated.

* Finish what you begin. Starting something is easier than finishing it. At the start of a project you have loads of energy and excitement but it takes huge amount of effort to finish what you started. Every time you finish something, you develop will. Finish it well and do a bit more than what you think you can do.
* Affirmation - remind yourself of your main goal and how you're going to get there with a clear choice of concise words
* Clear visualization of success - remind yourself of the fulfillment you get after completing a task and taking it to its logical end on the way to achieving your main goal

## Knowing your goal

Your mind is a tool and understanding it allows you to get to know your tool or yourself really well. The better you know you, the more you understand you. The more you understand you, the more you are able to use you to create what you want in life. The better you understand yourself, the more you are able to solve the challenges in your life.

What’s most important to you? This is a tough question to answer, because it requires you to think long and deep. The level of intelligence you are functioning at, depends upon your ability to know. Being humble enough to know your problems, your strengths and weaknesses and knowing exactly what you want to achieve is a continuous process, therefore depending upon when you ask yourself the question, you may get a different answer. Self evaluation and reflection is an important tool to know yourself, however research has also found people who are introspective are more likely to ruminate on negative thoughts when evaluating the self. You can be wrong about why you act, do, or think certain things. For instance, you might hear harsh feedback from a boss, and rationale it’s because you’re not cut out for the job, or harp on your insecurities. So how do you know what you know is true?

According to Indian epistemology and the ancient Indian philosophy *Vedanta*, knowledge can be acquired through four '*pramanas*' or valid sources of knowledge

* physical senses - sense perceptions are vital to knowledge but incomplete in themselves. They can be deceptive. e.g. a cold day might be too hot to someone else, the colour green can be perceived differently by various people. Since senses cannot be used as the sole arbitrator, the need arises for thinking.
* inference - through deduction logic and reason
* analogy/comparison - stories and ideas developed through art, literature and culture
* testimony/authority/revelation - go to the experts for knowledge
* experience - you learn lessons from your failures, however you may still learn the wrong lessons

* education - learn by reading and acquiring information
* experience - learn by making mistakes through failures
* intuition - smart people require very little information to know something - they see it they get it
* experience without learning - you fail to learn from experiences and make the same mistakes repeatedly

True intelligence is not acquired by just reading a book. It is developed through practices in focussing your attention inwards and applying critical thinking to the information that you may have gained through reading or through your experiences. In *Vedanta* knowledge is acquired by 20% reading and 80% thinking. The more time you take to analyze the information you have gained, apply it and test whether it provides the desired results you set out to achieve, the better you get at understanding and internalizing the knowledge. If you reflect upon an idea, that idea becomes you. However the practice of critical thinking by turning inwards requires time and effort. Seeking external pleasures e.g watching a film, eating your favorite food provide you instant joy. Critical thinking, acquiring knowledge and applying that knowledge is a long drawn out process and bears fruit in the long term.

The origins of a personal goal often start with an agitation, a resentment or an angst within to change or fix something in your life that doesn't let you sleep at night. In your own selfish interest you may decide to take action to change something that causes this extreme anguish. *The more the selfishness in an individual the higher is the mental agitation*. An agitated mind, therefore can lead you to your personal goal.

Nikola Tesla said *“If you wish to understand the Universe think of energy, frequency and vibration.“*

Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose.

Maintaining a journal of your goals over time, gives you the chance to reflect regularly upon your progress and whether the goal needs fine tuning.

## Being self aware around others

So you have a clear understanding of your goal, you are practicing self awareness and concentration in the pursuit of your goal. Having a clear goal and a vision is a great start, however getting others to pe part of that vision is a real challenge. You quickly discover that other people are not at the same level of consciousness as you, they function at different frequencies. They have different hopes, aspirations, fears and desires that may be in conflict with your own. This conflict brings your plans to a quick halt which can lead to frustration and often anger and resentment. When things are not going your way it can almost feel like the world is working against you.

*The more the mental agitation the less your intellect can function*.

### Make your goal a shared goal

An unstable mind filled with anger and resentment clouds your intellect and diminishes clarity. How do you overcome this obscured mind? By training it to feel comfortable while being uncomfortable. It is necessary to develop purity of thought and unselfishness in your pursuits by having a larger purpose that is beyond your immediate self.

>*If you want to go fast travel alone, if you want to go far travel together*

In order to attract people to you, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose. However, other people may not be at the same level of consciousness as you, they function at different frequencies.

>*If you work just for yourself, the whole world seems against you. If you work for others, the whole world works with you*

If the pursuit of your goal is solely for personal gain, others aren't necessarily going to play ball. However if you can provide a vision of positive change and help people think that they are part of something bigger than themselves, this can can elevate them towards your end goal. Intrinsic motivation is all about helping people discover the connection between their work and your vision, and it's about keeping that link fresh in people's minds. Commitment is intrinsic motivation in action. If you are intrinsically motivating your people, you will have true commitment without external pushes and pulls.

A goal that involves serving others can raise the consciousness of people around you  and your engagement with them will be at the same frequency as yours. This leads to deeper engagement and harmony.

Does this mean you give up everything you own in charity and start social service? Well you may very well decide to and that maybe a perfectly valid choice, however most people look to live a better life and money plays an important part in that pursuit. This may mean getting your dream job, make better investing decisions or starting a new venture.

>*Money is not a bad thing if profit is for the purpose of wider positive impact.*

Just like the human body needs oxygen to survive, a business needs profit to survive and flourish. However just like the human body is about more than just breathing, a business is about more than just profit. If a business is run with an intention to serve, profit can be utilized for the wider good. The drive for profit ensures the business is run efficiently without waste and holds the business accountable to its share holders.
