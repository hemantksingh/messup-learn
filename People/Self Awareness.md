# Awareness

*Your own self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world* - Ramana Maharishi

But what precisely does it mean to be self-aware? How did self-awareness emerge as a venerable trait and how do you cultivate it? More often than not our actions are outward looking, self awareness if the ability to look inwards and get to know yourself better.

There are a few things that we all should learn and know. Firstly, how the mind works. Then learning to focus. Followed by the understanding of how our energy works. And once we have a decent understanding of this, then knowing our purpose in life. Why do I think the above items are crucial? If you don’t understand how your mind works and you can’t focus it, then it is going to be difficult to begin the journey of getting to know yourself. And if you can’t get to know yourself then it’s going to be difficult to know your purpose in life. Your purpose tells you where you put your energy. In the pursuit of self awareness, it is important to know your goal, be continuously aware of that goal and work with others to achieve that goal.

Awareness is simply the act of keeping your attention on a particular area of the mind for an extended amount of time. In the context of mindfulness, it is often said to be in the moment, to be present right here, right now. That just means to be able to sustain your awareness on a single thing and not let it wander away into different areas of the mind. This could be while you are working, reading, training or talking to someone. Therefore the goal is not to control your mind but to control where awareness goes within your mind. Prolonged sates of concentration lead to deeper relationships with people and the power of observation. Power of observation allows you to see things from a birds eye view where you can see opportunities, pitfalls and make better decisions.
## Are you aware of your goal?

What’s most important to you? This is a tough question to answer, because it requires you to think long and deep. Knowing yourself, your strengths and weaknesses and knowing exactly what you want to achieve is a continuous process, therefore depending upon when you ask yourself the question, you may get a different answer.

The origins of a personal goal often start with an agitation, a resentment or an angst within to change or fix something in your life that doesn't let you sleep at night. In your own selfish interest you may decide to take action to change something that causes this extreme anguish. *The more the selfishness in an individual the higher is the mental agitation*. An agitated mind, therefore can lead you to your personal goal.

Nikola Tesla said *“If you wish to understand the Universe think of energy, frequency and vibration.“*

Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose.

Maintaining a journal of your goals over time, gives you the chance to reflect regularly upon your progress and whether the goal needs fine tuning.

## Enhancing consciousness

How many things do we do during the day with our at most concentration? Staying aware of one thing for prolonged amount of time without drifting away requires practice 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If you can integrate this into everything that you do throughout your day and throughout your life you can be in a heightened state of awareness.

* Build extraordinary habits by performing small rituals that constantly remind you of your goals.
* Simplify your day to day life with less material possessions. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. Energy flows to where your awareness goes. Material possessions e.g. mobile phones and social media are a great source of distraction and energy consumption. Fewer possessions mean less loss (haemorrhaging) of energy. One of the goals for monks is conservation of energy.

### Build will power

You use your will to take your awareness from one area of the mind to another. Will is like a muscle and it needs to be cultivated.

* Finish what you begin. Starting something is easier than finishing it. At the start of a project you have loads of energy and excitement but it takes huge amount of effort to finish what you started. Every time you finish something, you develop will. Finish it well and do a bit more than what you think you can do.
* Affirmation - remind yourself of your main goal and how you're going to get there with a clear choice of concise words
* Clear visualization of success - remind yourself of the fulfillment you get after completing a task and taking it to its logical end on the way to achieving your main goal

### Improve your intellect

The level of intelligence you are functioning at, depends upon your ability to attain knowledge. According to Indian epistemology and the ancient Indian philosophy *Vedanta*, knowledge can be acquired through four '*pramanas*' or valid sources of knowledge

- physical senses - sense perceptions are vital to knowledge but incomplete in themselves. They can be deceptive. e.g. a cold day might be too hot to someone else, the colour green can be perceived differently by various people. Since senses cannot be used as the sole arbitrator, the need arises for thinking.
- inference - through deduction logic and reason
- analogy/comparison - stories and ideas developed through art, literature and culture
- testimony/authority/revelation - go to the experts for knowledge
- experience - you learn lessons from your failures, however you may still learn the wrong lessons

* education - learn by reading and acquiring information
* experience - learn by making mistakes through failures
* intuition - smart people require very little information to know something - they see it they get it
* experience without learning - you fail to learn from experiences and make the same mistakes repeatedly

True intelligence is not acquired by reading a book. It is developed through practices in focussing your attention inwards and applying critical thinking to the information that you may have gained through reading or other sources. In *Vedanta* knowledge is acquired by 20% reading and 80% thinking. The more time you take to analyze the information you have gained, apply it and test whether it provides the desired results you set out to achieve, the better you get at understanding and internalizing the knowledge. If you reflect upon an idea, that idea becomes you. However the practice of critical thinking by turning inwards requires time and effort. Seeking external pleasures e.g watching a film, eating your favorite food provide you instant joy. Critical thinking, acquiring knowledge and applying that knowledge is a long drawn out process and bears fruit in the long term.

## Are you in control of your thoughts emotions and feelings?

So you have a clear understanding of your goal, you are practicing self awareness and consciousness in the pursuit of your goal. You very quickly discover that other people are not at the same level of consciousness as you, they function at different frequencies. They have different hopes, aspirations, fears and desires that may be in conflict with your own. This brings your plans to a quick halt which can lead to frustration, distress and often anger within yourselves. It almost can feel like the world is working against you?

*The more the mental agitation the less your intellect can function*.

An unstable mind filled with resentment and anger clouds your intellect and diminishes clarity. How do you overcome this obscured mind? By training it to feel comfortable while being uncomfortable. It becomes necessary to develop purity of thought and unselfishness in your pursuits by having a larger purpose that is beyond your immediate self.

*If you want to go fast travel alone, if you want to go far travel together*

In order to attract people to you, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose. However, other people are not at the same level of consciousness, they function at different frequencies. If the pursuit of your goal is solely for personal gain, others aren't going to play ball. However if you provide a future vision of positive change and make it about the wider good rather than just yourself, this can can elevate others towards a heightened state of consciousness - your end goal and your engagement with others will be at the same frequency. Rather than thinking about extracting from others think about serving others. This leads to deeper engagement and ultimately - harmony.

*If you work just for yourself, the whole world seems against you. If you work for others, the whole world works with you*

Does this mean you give up everything you own in charity or start social service? Well you may very well decide to and that maybe a perfectly valid choice for some, however most of us want to get ahead financially in life to have the freedom to do things that we love and enjoy most. This may mean getting your dream job, get better at investing or start a new venture.

*Money is not a bad thing if profit is for the purpose of wider positive impact.*

Just like the human body needs oxygen to survive, a business needs profit to survive and flourish. However just like the human body is about more than just breathing, a business is about more than just profit. If a business is run with an intention to serve, profit can be utilized for the wider good. The drive for profit ensures the business is run efficiently without waste and holds the business accountable to its share holders.
