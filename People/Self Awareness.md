# Being aware of your goal

Whatâ€™s most important to you? This is a tough question to answer, because it requires you to think long and deep. Knowing yourself and knowing exactly what you want to achieve is a continuous process, therefore depending upon when you ask the question, you may get a different answer.

The origins of your personal goal often start with an agitation or resentment within yourselves - the desire to change or fix something in your life that doesn't let you sleep comfortably at night. *The more the selfishness in an individual the higher is the mental agitation*. So the pursuit of your goal has a selfish origin within an agitated mind.

*The more the mental agitation the less your intellect can function*.

An unstable mind filled with resentment and anger clouds your intellect and diminishes clarity on how to go about achieving your primary goal. How do you overcome this obscured mind? By training it to feel comfortable while being uncomfortable. It becomes necessary to develop purity of thought and unselfishness in your pursuits by having a larger purpose that is beyond your immediate self.

*Money is not a bad thing if profit is for the purpose of wider positive impact.*

Just like the human body needs oxygen to survive, a business needs profit to survive and flourish, however the job of the human body is more than just breathing. Similarly, if businesses are run with an intention to serve, profit can be utilized for the wider good. The drive for profit ensures the business is run efficiently without waste and holds the business accountable to its share holders.

*If you want to go fast travel alone, if you want to go far travel together*

In order to attract people to you, think in terms of energy, vibration and frequency. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. If you are able to focus all your energy towards a **single purpose in life**, you are in a heightened state of consciousness because all your decisions are consciously driven by that purpose. However, other people are not at the same level of consciousness, they function at different frequencies. If you can elevate them towards a heightened state of consciousness - your end goal and provide a future vision of positive change, your engagement with others will be at the same frequency. This leads to deeper engagement and ultimately - harmony.

*If you work just for yourself, the whole world seems against you. If you work for others, the whole world works with you*

## Enhancing consciousness

The level of intelligence you are functioning at, depends upon your ability to attain knowledge. It could be through

* observation - smart people require very little information to know something - they see it they get it
* education - learn by reading and acquiring information
* experience - learn by making mistakes through failures
* experience without learning - you fail to learn from experiences and make the same mistakes repeatedly

True intelligence is acquired by possessing little knowledge and applying critical thinking to it. Knowledge in *vedanta* is acquired by 20% reading and 80% thinking. The more time you take to analyze the information you have gained, apply it and test whether it is true, the better you get at internalizing the knowledge. If you reflect upon an idea, that idea becomes you. However the practice of critical thinking by looking inwards requires effort, there is no instant joy as you get by seeking external pleasures. The process of critical thinking, acquiring knowledge and applying that knowledge bears fruit in the long term.

Staying aware of one thing for prolonged amount of time without drift away requires practice 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If you can integrate this into everything that you do throughout your life, you can get better at it.

* Perform small rituals throughout the day that remind you about your purpose. How many things do we do during the day with our at most concentration to be in a heightened state of awareness ?

* Simplify your day to day life with less material possessions. Life is a manifestation of where you put your energy. Energy flows to where your awareness goes. Material possessions can consume energy. Fewer possessions mean less loss (haemorrhaging) of energy. One of the goals for monks is conservation of energy.

## Building will power

* Affirmation - remind yourself of your main goal and how you're going to get there with a clear choice of concise words
* Clear visualization of success - remind yourself of the fulfillment you get after completing a task and taking it to its logical end on the way to achieving your main goal
