# People

Understanding that not all people are the same and that they are driven by different motivations is crucial to knowing them. Some of the [behavioural traits](https://www.scienceofpeople.com/category/behavioral-psychology) to look out for are: 
* conscientious - people who are execution oriented and love to work towards a plan. Rather than being driven by the bigger picture they may want specific and clear instructions about their day to day activities.
* neurotic - reactive and often think about the things that could go wrong and press the panic button
* introverts but contemplative - some technical people may feel comfortable in front of a machine but people make them nervous? They do not want to deal with confrontation? Are you sure you want to deal continuously with someone who emotionally confronts us? Being alone, sitting in front of a machine for hours recharges your emotional batteries.

## Human Insight

The deepest urge in human nature is
* **the desire to be important** - John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosopher. It is what Freud calls "the desire to be great". The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.
  * Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in our praise.
  * **Recognition** and sincere appreciation is one of the secrets of dealing with people. Charles Schwab - one of the first people to be paid a salary of 1 million dollars a year says he was paid his salary because of his ability to deal with people. "*I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people*" said Schwab. The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. The difference between appreciation and flattery ? One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other is selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
  
* **the desire to belong** - people are social animals and have the innate ability to gravitate towards others with common shared values and beliefs, form communities and cultures. When you are surrounded by people with shared values and beliefs - trust emerges.
  * You find others with similar beliefs and values by striking conversations and becoming genuinely interested in them. Often liking someone is a gut instinct, an intuitive decision, because it just feels right. The part of your brain that controls feeling, controls decision making it doesn't control language, it cannot rationalise why you like someone. 
  * Clarity about your beleifs and values gives you a purpose. Ability to clearly communicate your vision and repeat it often can rally others behind your cause
  * A carrot and stick (reward and punishment) policy has limited effect when dealing with people. If you want people to be truly engaged in your vision give them **autonomy, mastery and purpose** - Daniel Pink
  
Ways to make people like you - become genuinely interested in other people. Go beyond the small talk and have meaningful conversations keeping their interests in mind. 
* Move from **How are you** to **Who you are** conversations. So instead of asking 
  * *Where did you grow up?* ask *Whats your story?* 
  * *What do you do?* ask *What made you who you are today*?
  * *What do you do in free time?* ask *Do you have a secret side hussle or passion project?*
* People like to know that they are interesting. Doing some research about your prospect to find out what interests them most and what they are enthusiastic about, before an important meeting can help you in getting their attention. 
  * After they finish what they have to say: *Thats interesting* or if they have been interrupted: *You were saying something interesting, please finish*
  * Working with you is always so easy
  * Last time we talked you mentioned you were doing this training - how did that go?
* Use positive phrases while starting conversations:
  * *Hey Brad I was just thinking about you, How are you?*
  * Anytime someone calls you - I'm so glad you called, I was just thinking about you the other day
  * The other day I was watching this Netflix documentary and I thought of you
  * Hey long time no talk, someone recently talked to me about a great lawyer recommendation and I thought of you
 * Expressing vulnerability
   * People wait for you to share something intimate before opening up to you. After sharing something intimate, you may finish with *What about you?*
 * Showing up at events and gatherings is one way of proving what you believe. Increasing your exposure can increase your likeability
 * Providing reassurance during a difficult decision. Show concern, ask what's worrying them? e.g. I sense there's something worrying you.
 
Winning people over to your way of thinking
* The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.
* If you have made a mistake, admit that you're wrong and do it emphatically rather than defending yourself. *Dale Carnegie* suggests you own your mistake and vent how terrible the mistake was so you deflate the other person's anger.
  
Putting your point across
* Change people without giving offence or arouse resentment: **Always talk about your own mistakes first**
* When disagreeing with someone **make your point in a general sense**. Tackle the problem rather than the individual. Rejection of your viewpoint results in anger and pain. 
 * Rather than saying *"No, the COP is a something that cannot be done away with"*, say something like
 *"Whilst commercials of the business are of great importance, in order to drive new thinking and give people a sense of purpose it is important for them to get together and align on shared values and goals"*

## Prepare for predictable and unpredictable questions, situations

* People in position of responsibility will check your confidence in your decisions. In order to get to the facts, they will often dig deep, sometimes through confrontation.
  * In a *yes/no* decision come to 0 to 100% position e.g. *Based on our fact finding exercise and the data collected we are 100% sure of our recommendations*
  * On discovering new information (e.g. Organisation restructure plan), **bounce a question back**, e.g. *So what impact would the organisation restructure have on the project teams?*
* Get back with an answer in case of an unknown. Mention the PROCESS you will follow to get the answer
* Bounce a question back. Have you set out a budget for this piece of work?
* Give an indicative answer to manage expectations. In our experience ...
* Preempt the question. Get in there first
* Ask questions when you get emotional reactions, show you are concerned
