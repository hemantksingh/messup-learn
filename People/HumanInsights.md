# People

Understanding that not all people are the same and that they are driven by different motivations is crucial to knowing them.

* Some technical people may be introverts but contemplative. They feel comfortable in front of a machine but people make them nervous? They do not want to deal with confrontation? Are you sure you want to deal continuously with someone who emotionally confronts us?
  * Recharge your emotional batteries by being alone, sitting in front of a machine for hours

* People in position of responsibility will check your confidence in your decisions. They will often put pressure on you to get to the facts, sometimes through confrontation.
  * In a *yes/no* decision come to 0 to 100% position e.g. *Based on our fact finding exercise and the data collected we are 100% sure of our recommendations*
  * On discovering new information (e.g. Organisation restructure plan), **bounce a question back**, e.g. *So what impact would the organisation restructure have on the project teams?*

* Some people are more execution oriented. Rather than being driven by the bigger picture may want specific and clear instructions about their day to day activities.

## Human Insight

The only way I can get you to do anything is by giving you what you want.

* The deepest urge in human nature is "**the desire to be important**" - John Dewey, one of America's most profound philosopher. It is what Freud calls "the desire to be great". The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.

* **Recognition** Sincere appreciation is one of the secrets of dealing with people. Charles Schwab - one of the first people to be paid a salary of 1 million dollars a year says he was paid his salary because of his ability to deal with people. "*I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people*" said Schwab. The way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. The difference between appreciation and flattery ? One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other is selfish. One is universally admired; the other universally condemned.
* Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in our praise.
  
* A carrot and stick (reward and punishment) policy has limited effect when dealing with people. If you want people to be truly engaged in your vision give them **autonomy, mastery and purpose** - Daniel Pink 
*A clear vision that is repeated often gives people a purpose*
  
* Ways to make people like you - become genuinely interested in other people. Go beyond the small talk and have meaningful conversations keeping their interests in mind. Doing some research about your prospect to find out what interests them most and what they are enthusiastic about, before an important meeting can help you in getting their attention.

* Winning people over to your way of thinking - If you have made a mistake, admit that you're wrong and do it emphatically rather than defending yourself. *Dale Carnegie* suggests you own your mistake and vent how terrible the mistake was so you deflate the other person's anger.
  
### Putting your point across

Change people without giving offence or arouse resentment: **Always talk about your own mistakes first**

It is often useful to talk in general terms rather than disagree on a specific point that has been made. Rejection of another view point results in anger and pain. fMRI studies show that the same areas of the brain become activated when we experience rejection as when we experience physical pain. This is why rejection hurts so much (neurologically speaking). Therefore try to **make your point in a general sense**.

e.g. on a Kanban wall a point of view could be to move cards backwards if QA finds a bug. If you happen to disagree with moving cards backwards an option would be to just say:

*"No, the cards do not move back in a Kanban wall because ... (for whatever legitimate reason)"*

Or you could define what "QA" stage in your process means and what kind of activities it covers.

*"One of common approaches is that QA stage covers both testing and fixing bugs, which means that it is perfectly normal to work on the code, namely fix bugs, when a feature is in QA stage."*

### Prepare for predictable and unpredictable questions, situations

* Get back with an answer. Mention the PROCESS you would follow to get the answer.

* Bounce a question back. Have you set out a budget for this piece of work?

* Give an indicative answer to manage expectations. In our experience ...

* Preempt the question. Get in there first.

* Ask questions when you get emotional reactions, show you are concerned.

### Building rapport

* Reassure them. Ask what's worrying them? e.g. I sense there's something worrying you.

* Show them something, if they are standing up or are restless

* Get them to do the introduction. What's your understanding of the purpose of the meeting?

## Planning for meetings

* Get executives to introduce your meeting, in order to get buy in.

Go into a meeting with a clear

* Background
* Objective, what would success look like?
* Set of deliverables
* Actions, activities
* Summary
