# Tech Capabilities

## DevOps

The union of people, processes and products to enable continuous delivery of value to end users.

People who can work with clients to shape and oversee engagements that are primarily infra/ops oriented

* Transforming infra/ops departments (i.e. reorganising them and getting them to adopt agile practices across the department, bridging silos and adopt DevOps culture by having **cross functional teams** capable of **building, running and supporting their apps**.

* People who know what it's like to shape and manage Cloud migrations strategies, who can talk to a client about the impact of moving to cloud on their budgeting **moving from CapEx to OpEx** (e.g moving from owning a car to renting a car), managing technical budgets and pros and cons of adoption of IAAS, PAAS or FAAS.

* Product specialist equivalent? The answer to these gaps may not be Principal Technologists. Product specialists may not be true technologists, not PMs, not BAs, not CPs but may run serious infra/ops engagements, alongside a technologist and other roles.

* Non-technical roles, e.g. BA, QA, UX, have a different experience from devs, in that they don't typically lead teams, or work with others of their own sort except with very large engagements. But it feels to me like DevOps becoming a different thing, not because it's technical, but because it's becoming the central focus of certain types of engagements (e.g. cloud migration)

### CI/CD best practices and principles
Adopting Infra as Code approaches to delivering infrastructure

* separate infrastructure provisioning & configuration management
    * snowflake or ephemeral servers?
    * cattle not pets
* separate application build, deployment and release
    * separate code deployment from config deployment
    * is your config auditable & version controlled?
* build once deploy multiple times
* dev test, prod parity
* fast feedback - run fastest tests early
* security baked into your pipeline 
    * no secrets in source code
    * store secrets in a vault not in auto-generated files on a CI server
    * run with least privileges

## Tech lead or principal

Traditionally, a lead developer needs to lead teams. A principal developer needs to influence client execs. If you don't fit into a team leadership role, or you aren't big on consulting and influencing, you don't progress.

* Relatively more hands-on work than big picture
* Building a technical Vision
* Managing cross-functional requirements
* Preparing for the path to production
* Technical risk management
* Come up with a solution to an ambiguous set of problems
* Management driven technology or (Ivory architects)

Other ways technical people can add equivalent value. For example, being more of a deep technical expert on projects, or being able to play with client enterprise architects, or being a technical mentor, etc.
