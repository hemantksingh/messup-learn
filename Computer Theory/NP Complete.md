# P = NP

P - Set of all problems that can be solved in polynomial time. Polynomial time means that the time measured as the number of steps (S) required to solve a problem is a polynomial function of the input size (n).

S = f(n).

Polynomials are functions involving n + 5 or 2n + 5 or n^2 or 12n^7 - 6n^5 i.e they can be computed in reasonably fast time, e.g multiplication and sorting a collection of names alphabetically. Multiplication of even exponential numbers can be performed quickly even on a phone.

NP - Set of all problems that can take exponential time to solve. e.g. 2^n as n increases the time required grows exponentially. Solution to a sudoku is an NP problem because as the number of grids increase on a sudoku grid it gets harder and harder for a computer to solve it in quick time.

P = NP
*Does being able to quickly verify the answer to a problem mean there is a quick way to solve it too ?*

For example figuring out a solution to sudoku takes time but verifying the correctness of a sudoku solution is relatively quicker *(Hard to solve, easy to check)*. Does that mean we should be able to find a solution to Sudoku quicker too? or is NP = P ? No body has been able to prove or disprove this.

For playing absolutely perfect chess there is no fast program. It falls in the EXP set of problems.

NP Complete Problems - Set of problems that could be reduced to solving a single task. Solving the really hard part would result in solving all the problems, as they are connected to the same NP Complete level traversal.
