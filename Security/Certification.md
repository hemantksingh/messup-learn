## Organisational certifications

### Cyber Essentials

Cyber Essentials Certification indicates that the organisation has implemented a sensible baseline of organisational cyber security only, and implies no gaurantee of effective defence against commodity cyber attacks circumventing the baseline. Organisations are recommended to define and understand the risks to their organisation and take all appropriate action to mitigate or reduce any issues, which may require a greater degree of rigour or technical investment than is required for Cyber Essentials alone.
