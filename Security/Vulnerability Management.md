# Vulnerability Management

When originally deployed, [vulnerability management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_management) companies acted almost like antivirus vendors in that they tried to get their scanners to uncover as many potential threats as possible. They would even brag about being able to detect more vulnerabilities hiding in testbeds than their competitors. The trouble with that logic is that unlike viruses and other types of malware, vulnerabilities are only potentially a problem. For a vulnerability to be truly dangerous, it must be accessible to an attacker and relatively easy to exploit. So, a vulnerability sitting on an internal resource isnâ€™t much of a potential threat, nor is one that requires additional components like secure access to other network services. Knowing what is truly dangerous is important so that you can plan what to fix now, and what to put off until later or even ignore.

## Tenable.io

Tenable is well known in the industry for creating security dashboards for any environment. They bring that same diagnostic technology to their vulnerability management program, Tenable.io. This platform is managed in the cloud, so it has a small footprint inside a protected organization. It uses a combination of active scanning agents, passive monitoring and cloud connectors to search for vulnerabilities. Tenable.io then applies machine learning, data science and AI to predict which fixes need to be made first before an attacker can exploit them.

One of the biggest strengths of Tenable.io is the fact that it uses both the dashboard and its customized reports to show vulnerabilities in a way that anyone can understand. Whether someone is a developer, part of the operations team or a member of IT security, they can easily comprehend the warnings generated by Tenable.io. In a way, Tenable.io provides vulnerability management to everyone with no specialized training or expertise required.

## VirusTotal

VirusTotal is antivirus aggregator that [inspects items with over 70 antivirus scanners](https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002126889-How-it-works) and URL/domain blacklisting services and can check for viruses that the user's on antivirus may have missed. It can notify Anti virus software vendors of files flagged by other scans but passed by their own engine to help improve their software and by extension VT's own capability.

VirusTotal's aggregated data is the output of many different

- antivirus engines
- website scanners
- file and URL analysis tools - discriminate between malware sites, phishing sites, suspicious sites, etc
- user contributions

The file and URL characterization tools that are aggregated cover a wide range of purposes: heuristic (shortcut approximations) engines, known-bad signatures, metadata extraction, identification of malicious signals, etc

The [VirusTotal Public API](https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference#overview) based on the  http://jsonapi.org/ specification provides the aggregated antivirus scanning and URL/domain balcklisting services.

### Malware hunting

VT's [YARA](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable) is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware researchers to **identify and classify malware** samples. With YARA you can 
- create descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on textual or binary patterns
- automatically create IOCs (Indicators of Compromise): artifact observed on a network or OS that with high confidence indicates a computer intrusion

[Livehunt](https://support.virustotal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001315437) allows you to hook into the stream of files analyzed by VirusTotal and get notified whenever one of them matches a certain rule written in the YARA language. By matching the submitted files with YARA you should be able to 
- get a constant flow of malware files classified by family
- discover new malware flying under the industry's radar
- collect files written in a given language or packed with a specific run-time packer
- create heuristic rules to detect suspicious files
- track threat actors, and, in general, enjoy the benefits of YARA's versatility acting on the huge amount of files processed by VirusTotal every day
