# Securing the API Server

Authentication in Kubernetes is configurable, and you could define one or more authentication methods for your API server. An authentication plugin is defined by the cluster administrator with configuration parameters on the API server itself. There are no usernames stored in the API server for authentication purposes, it's up to the selected authentication plugin to define and implement how a user is defined and authenticated. Some of the common authentication plugins available are:

* Client Certificates - most commonly used way to authenticate to the API server e.g. in managed cloud service like AKS. A request is authenticated when a valid, trusted certificate is presented as part of the HTTP request. Certificate contains the username (used for authorization - i.e. what the user can do) in the Common Name (CN) field of the certificate.
* Authentication Tokens - HTTP Authorization header in the client request
* Basic Http - uses static password files read during API server startup, simple to setup and use (Dev)

Open ID Connect enables external identity providers for authentication and remote authentication services. This requires additional set up integration with that external provider, but enables you to have a centralized user database which can facilitate for single sign on this, convey useful in scenarios where you have multiple clusters or multiple applications that require centralized authentication services for your organization.

The main idea here is that authentication is plugable and you have the ability to use one or more than one method for authentication.

## Certificate based authentication

Kubernetes uses certificates to provide TLS encryption. The API server is exposed on an https endpoint using a certificate. In addition to providing encryption, certificates are also used for authenticating both users and system components.

Every Kubernetes cluster has a cluster root Certificate Authority (CA). The CA is generally used by cluster components to validate the API serverâ€™s certificate, by the API server to validate `kubelet` or `kubectl` client certificates, etc. There can be [more than one CAs in a kubernetes cluster](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/08/05/how-kubernetes-certificates-work/) e.g API server CA and kubelete CA.

The API server provides a certificate API enabling you to submit a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to be used to [request X.509 certificates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tls/managing-tls-in-a-cluster/#requesting-a-certificate). Once generated and signed you can download a certificate for use in your cluster by users and system components. This could be done at the command line using certificate tools like `OpenSSL` or `CFSSSL`, but the API provides a programmatic interface for Certificate management for the internal cluster self signed CA on the control plane node.

```sh
# Get the client certificate from kubeconfig
kubectl config view --raw -o jsonpath='{ .users[*].user.client-certificate-data }' | base64 --decode > admin.crt

# Inspect the client certificate
openssl x509 -in admin.crt -text -noout | more

```

## Authorization with service accounts

Running a pod in kunernetes without a specified service account runs it with the default service account.

```sh
# List all service accounts
kubectl get serviceaccounts

# Check if a service account <serviceaccountname> is authorized to list pods by impersonating as the <serviceaccountname>
kubectl auth can-i list pods --as=system:serviceaccount:default:<serviceaccountname>
```

## Compliance

How do you embed security and validate compliance against standards like PCI, NIST, and SOC2 across the lifecycle of containers and Kubernetes?
